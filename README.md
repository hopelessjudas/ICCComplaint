# Hopeless Judas — Field Tools for Accountability

**This is not code. This is leverage.**  
Templates, manifests, and one-page kits for people who are done screaming at the timeline and ready to put paper on power. Use it, fork it, rip it for parts. Make it louder.

> **HJ Thesis:** Pain engineered into policy is a design choice. We document it. We name it. We press where it hurts.

## What’s in here

- **ICC Article 15 Kit (Border Wall “Paint It Black”)**
  - `ICC_Article15_Communication_Border_Wall_Black_Paint_Template.docx`
  - `Cover_Letter_to_OTP_Template.docx`
  - `ICC_Article15_Submission_Checklist.docx`
  - Purpose: a ready-to-fill packet to submit information to the International Criminal Court Prosecutor regarding the policy of painting the U.S.–Mexico border wall black to increase heat and inflict pain as deterrence. It’s a communication, not a lawsuit—but it leaves fingerprints in the right place.

## Quickstart

1. **Download** the DOCX files (or grab the release ZIP).  
2. **Fill** in only what you’re safe to share. Remove personal info if needed.  
3. **Attach** any lawful evidence you have (public statements, local reporting, photos you took).  
4. **Submit** via the ICC OTP portal. Then share the kit with someone else.

> **Not legal advice.** This is a citizen tool, not counsel. If you have a lawyer, talk to them.

## Why this exists

Because “policy” that weaponizes heat against human skin isn’t governance—it’s cruelty with a purchase order. We don’t normalize it. We **document** it. We **pressure** it. We **persist**.

## Safety Notes

- If you’re vulnerable, submit **anonymously**.  
- Strip metadata from images.  
- Share only what you have the right to share.  
- Don’t be brave for sport. Be effective.
